# bot
Minecraft pvp bot for mostly flat areas used to practice hit consistence and aim. 
Difficulty can be adjusted as well as bot acting - just moving around or hitting too.
Use it without ping issue, just absolute loww ping. Suitable for beginners and also for people who struggle with aim or getting comboed.

# compatible minecraft versions
If you update frequently it should follow support of mineflayer, bot knows whether it is old pvp (<1.9, bedwars, soup, combo (hypixel)) or new (1.9+, 1.19,1.20...)
